GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
<br><br>
The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. my customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why I have implemented GDPR controls as my baseline standard for all my operations worldwide.

What is personal data?
 </h3> <div class="policy_text">  <p class="_24"> 
Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
 </p>  </div>  </div> <div class="policy_part">  <h3 class="_48 policy_title"> 
The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
 </h3> <div class="policy_text">  <ul class="policy_list">  <li class="policy_item">  <p class="_24"> 
Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
 </p>  </li> <li class="policy_item">  <p class="_24"> 
Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
 </p>  </li> <li class="policy_item">  <p class="_24"> 
Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.
 </p>  </li> <li class="policy_item">  <p class="_24"> 
People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.

Why is GDPR important?
 </h3> <div class="policy_text">  <p class="_24"> 
GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Stanislav Bondar I strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and I already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
